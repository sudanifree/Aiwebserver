Regression coverage for GitHub issue #1818: print_scan_stats() (device_handling.py)
undercounted "down_alerts"/"new_down_alerts" whenever a device's stored MAC and its
CurrentScan MAC differed only by case.

DevicesView exposes devMac as LOWER(IFNULL(devMac, '')) - a function-derived VIEW
column, not a bare table column. print_scan_stats()'s down-alert subqueries compared
it against CurrentScan.scanMac as `devMac = scanMac` (DevicesView column on the LEFT),
which - unlike a bare COLLATE NOCASE column comparison - loses NOCASE collation and
becomes a case-sensitive byte comparison. Reversing the operand order to
`scanMac = devMac` restores NOCASE collation (SQLite gives precedence to the left
operand's column collation; scanMac is a real COLLATE-free CurrentScan column but the
comparison still resolves via devMac's declared NOCASE affinity once devMac is on the
right, verified empirically against a real SQLite instance built from the actual
DevicesView definition - see server/scan/device_handling.py print_scan_stats()).

This function is diagnostic/verbose-log-only (mylog("verbose"/"trace", ...), no other
consumer) - it does not drive real "Device Down" notifications, which go through
session_events.insert_events() -> presence.current_scan_presence_condition() instead
and were already safe (scanMac on the left there). This test covers the diagnostic
counter only.
