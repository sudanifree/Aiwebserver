## Overview: Sync Hub for MSP & Multi-Site Deployments

The synchronization plugin is designed to synchronize data across multiple instances of the app. It supports the following data synchronization modes:

1. **💻 Devices**: Sends an encrypted `table_devices.json` file to synchronize the entire Devices database table.
2. **🔌 Plugin Data**: Sends encrypted `last_result.log` files for individual plugins.


> [!TIP]
> This plugin is usually used if you need to monitor inaccessible networks (WAN, VLAN etc.). Read the [Remote networks documentation](https://docs.netalertx.com/REMOTE_NETWORKS) for more details about these scenarios.

### Synchronization Modes

The plugin operates in three different modes based on the configuration settings.

> **Note:** `[n]` indicates a setting specified for the node instance, and `[n,h]` indicates a setting used on both the node and the hub instances.

1. **Mode 1: PUSH (NODE)** - Sends data from the node to the hub.
   - This mode is activated if `SYNC_hub_url` is set and either `SYNC_devices` or `SYNC_plugins` is enabled.
   - **Actions**:
     - Sends `table_devices.json` to the hub if `SYNC_devices` is enabled.
     - Sends individual plugin `last_result.log` files to the hub if `SYNC_plugins` is enabled.

2. **Mode 2: PULL (HUB)** - Retrieves data from nodes to the hub.
   - This mode is activated if `SYNC_nodes` is set.
   - **Actions**:
     - Retrieves data from configured nodes using the API and saves it locally for further processing.

3. **Mode 3: RECEIVE (HUB)** - Processes received data on the hub.
   - Activated when data is received in Mode 2 and is ready to be processed.
   - **Actions**:
     - Decodes received data files, processes them, and updates the Devices table accordingly.

### Settings

#### Node (Source) Settings `[n]`

- **API Token** `[n,h]`: `API_TOKEN` (has to be same across all nodes)

- **When to Run** `[n,h]`: `SYNC_RUN`
- **Schedule** `[n,h]`: `SYNC_RUN_SCHD`
- **Encryption Key** `[n,h]`: `SYNC_encryption_key`
- **Node Name** `[n]`: `SYNC_node_name`
- **Hub URL** `[n]`: `SYNC_hub_url` + `GRAPHQL_PORT` of the target
- **Sync Devices** `[n]`: `SYNC_devices`
- **Sync Plugins** `[n]`: `SYNC_plugins`

#### Hub (Target) Settings `[h]`

- **API Token** `[n,h]`: `API_TOKEN` (has to be same across all nodes)

- **When to Run** `[n,h]`: `SYNC_RUN`
- **Schedule** `[n,h]`: `SYNC_RUN_SCHD`
- **Encryption Key** `[n,h]`: `SYNC_encryption_key`
- **Nodes to Pull From** `[h]`: `SYNC_nodes` + `GRAPHQL_PORT` of the source nodes
- **Hub Behavior** `[h]`: `SYNC_BEHAVIOR` - controls how the hub writes devices received from nodes (see [below](#hub-device-write-behavior-sync_behavior))

### Usage

1. **Adjust Settings**:
   - Navigate to **Settings** > **Sync Hub** to modify default settings.
2. **Data Flow**:
   - Nodes send or receive data based on the specified modes, either pushing data to the hub or pulling from nodes.

### Notes

- How existing and new devices are handled on the hub depends on the `SYNC_BEHAVIOR` setting (see below).
- It is recommended to use Device synchronization primarily. Plugin data synchronization is more suitable for specific use cases.

### Hub Device-Write Behavior (`SYNC_BEHAVIOR`)

The `SYNC_BEHAVIOR` setting - configured on the **hub only** - controls how the hub writes devices received from nodes.

| Value | Default? | Devices written | Source of truth | Recommended when |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `copy-new` | ✅ | New devices only (INSERT OR IGNORE) | Node (first sync), then Hub | You want the hub to start with the node's existing config and manage devices from there. |
| `carbon-copy` | | All devices on every sync (UPSERT) | Node | The node owns device config end-to-end. **All** hub fields are overwritten on every sync, including LOCKED. Do not customize devices on the hub. |
| `hub-defaults` | | None — hub pipeline handles insertion | Hub | Nodes provide presence data only; all device config is set and maintained on the hub. |

#### `copy-new` (default)

New devices are inserted using all available column values from the node's existing record (name, alert settings, vendor, etc.). If the device already exists on the hub, the INSERT is silently skipped.

Subsequent syncs update only empty/unknown fields on the hub (e.g., if the hub's `devName` is `(unknown)` and the node now has a resolved name, it propagates). Fields customized by a user on the hub (fields with source set to `USER` or `LOCKED`) are never overwritten.

```
First sync:  INSERT with node's full config
Next syncs:  empty fields updated only (name, vendor) via scan pipeline
User edits:  protected — never overwritten
```

#### `carbon-copy`

All received devices are upserted on every sync. The node is treated as fully authoritative: its values overwrite **all** hub fields on every sync cycle, including fields with `USER` or `LOCKED` source.

> ⚠️ Do not customize devices on the hub when using `carbon-copy`. Any hub-side changes will be overwritten on the next sync.

```
First sync:  UPSERT with node config
Next syncs:  UPSERT — node values win (all fields, no exceptions)
User edits:  overwritten on next sync
```

#### `hub-defaults`

**The hub is the source of truth.** Nodes contribute only presence data (MAC, IP, vendor from scans). All device configuration — name, alerts, notes, group — should be set on the hub. Node-side values for those fields are ignored.

Use this mode when you want the hub to behave as a fully independent instance — it receives presence data from nodes but manages its own device configuration.

```
First sync:  NEWDEV defaults applied
Next syncs:  empty fields updated only via scan pipeline
User edits:  set and maintained on the hub — never overwritten
```

### Example use case: Network Setup with Multiple VLANs and VM Scanning

> Thank you to [@richtj999](https://github.com/richtj999) for the use case 🙏

I have 6 VLANs, all isolated by a firewall, except for one VLAN that has access to all the others.

Initially, I had one virtual machine (VM) with 6 network cards, one for each VLAN. While this setup worked, it introduced delays due to other concurrent scans. To optimize this, I switched to a multi-VM setup:

- I created 6 VMs, each attached to a single VLAN.
- One VM acts as the "server," and the other 5 as "clients."
- The server has access to all VLANs (via firewall rules) and collects data from the client VMs, which each scan their own VLAN.

#### Summary

- **Single VM on six VLANs**: Slower because one VM scans all networks.
- **Six VMs on six VLANs**: Faster because each VM scans its own network, sending the results to the server.

#### Example Setup

- **VM1 ("Server")**: Network 1 (can access all networks) - IP: `10.10.10.106`
  Receives data from all NetAlertX clients and scans network 1.

- **VM2 ("Client")**: Network 2 (can access only network 2) - IP: `192.168.x.x`
  Scans network 2; VM1 retrieves this data.

- **VM3 ("Client")**: Network 3 (can access only network 3) - IP: `192.168.x.x`
  Scans network 3; VM1 retrieves this data.

- **VM4 ("Client")**: Network 4 (can access only network 4) - IP: `192.168.x.x`
  Scans network 4; VM1 retrieves this data.

- **VM5 ("Client")**: Network 5 (can access only network 5) - IP: `192.168.x.x`
  Scans network 5; VM1 retrieves this data.

- **VM6 ("Client")**: Network 6 (can access only network 6) - IP: `192.168.x.x`
  Scans network 6; VM1 retrieves this data.

#### How to Set It Up

##### Server (VM1)

1. Go to **Settings > System > Sync Hub**.
2. Set the schedule (5 minutes works for me).
3. **API Token**: Use any string, but it must match the clients (e.g., `abc123`).
4. **Encryption Key**: Use any string, but it must match the clients (e.g., `abc123`).
5. Under **Nodes**, add the full URL for each client, e.g., `http://192.168.1.20.20212/`, where the port `20212` is the value of the `GRAPHQL_PORT` setting of the given node (client)
6. **Node Name**: Leave blank.
7. Check **Sync Devices**.

##### Clients (VM2, VM3, VM4, VM5, VM6)

1. Go to **Settings > System > Sync Hub**.
2. Set **When to run** to "Always after scan."
3. **API Token**: Use the same token as the server (e.g., `abc123`).
4. **Encryption Key**: Use the same key as the server (e.g., `abc123`).
5. Leave **Nodes** blank.
6. Set **Node Name** to a unique, memorable name for each client.
7. Check **Sync Devices**.
