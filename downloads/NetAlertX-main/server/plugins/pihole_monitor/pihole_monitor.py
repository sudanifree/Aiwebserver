"""NetAlertX plugin: PIHOLEMON — Pi-hole Monitor

Does two jobs against the same Pi-hole connection(s), instead of two
separately configured plugins:

  1. Device import (same job as the official PIHOLEAPI/pihole_api_scan
     plugin): pulls the device list from Pi-hole's `/api/network/devices`
     and feeds it into NetAlertX's normal device-scanner pipeline
     (mapped_to_table=CurrentScan), so devices Pi-hole knows about but
     NetAlertX doesn't get created automatically.

  2. Query anomaly detection: pulls `/api/stats/top_clients?blocked=true`
     and flags a device whose blocked-query count spikes well above its
     own recent rolling average - the signature of malware/a compromised
     device beaconing out, not just "a lot of DNS traffic".

Why one plugin instead of two: they need the exact same Pi-hole session
(auth once, reuse for both endpoints) and the exact same "primary +
optional secondary" source list, so splitting them would mean either two
logins per source or two separately configured URL/password pairs to keep
in sync. One plugin, one settings page, one login per source.

Why not just run two copies of the official PIHOLEAPI plugin for two
Pi-holes: we looked into this first. `pihole_api_scan.py` hardcodes its
settings-key prefix (`PIHOLEAPI_URL`, `PIHOLEAPI_PASSWORD`, ...) as literal
strings throughout the script rather than reading it from `config.json`.
Duplicating the plugin folder gives you two copies that both read and
write the *same* settings keys - not two independent instances - and
NetAlertX's own plugin docs don't describe an officially supported way to
run multiple instances of one plugin. Making a real second instance would
mean forking the script and renaming every occurrence of the prefix by
hand, then keeping that fork in sync with any upstream changes by hand
too. This plugin exists so none of that is necessary: it accepts a second
set of credentials natively, and the secondary instance is entirely
optional - leave its URL blank and this behaves like a single-Pi-hole
import, which covers most setups.
